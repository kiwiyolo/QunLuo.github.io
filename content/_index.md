      text: |-
        My research combines hydrology with artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze runoff variability on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. I use advanced AI techniques, including convolutional and recurrent neural networks, for predicting satellite precipitation. Currently, I focus on developing large-scale hydrological models and enhancing environmental modeling efficiency through automated data processing and algorithm design.

        I apply a range of AI methods to analyze and explain hydrological phenomena.
