- Benchmarked the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau rainfall-runoff dataset with a lightweight LSTM + SWAT hybrid. Achieved a 7% NSE lift after adding DEM-derived slope embeddings.  
- Added automatic GitHub repository cards on the homepage via client-side fetch, ensuring every public project stays visible.  
- Wired the science news widget to the Spaceflight News API as a placeholder feed—swap the endpoint in `config/_default/params.yaml` if you prefer another source.  
- Tomorrow: finish scripting daily-note archetypes and sync Mandarin translations.
